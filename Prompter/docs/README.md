# Prompter Documentation

Welcome to Prompter - a macOS menu bar app that displays hidden speaker notes during presentations.

## What is Prompter?

Prompter lets you see your notes while sharing your screen in Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, or Zoom. The overlay floats above all windows but is hidden from screen capture, so your audience sees your presentation while you see your notes.
