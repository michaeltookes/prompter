All shortcuts work globally - even when Prompter is not the active application. This lets you control your notes while presenting in Google Meet, Teams, or any other app.

## Overlay Controls

| `Cmd+Shift+O` | Show/hide overlay |
| `Cmd+Shift+P` | Toggle Protected Mode |
| `Cmd+Shift+C` | Toggle click-through mode |

## Navigation

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd+Shift+→` | Next card |
| `Cmd+Shift+←` | Previous card |

## Display

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd+Shift+=` | Increase font size |
| `Cmd+Shift+-` | Decrease font size |
| `Cmd+Shift+]` | Increase opacity (more solid) |
| `Cmd+Shift+[` | Decrease opacity (more transparent) |

## Tips

- **Presenting**: Keep the overlay visible and use `Cmd+Shift+→` and `Cmd+Shift+←` to navigate while your presentation app is focused
- **Quick hide**: Press `Cmd+Shift+O` to instantly hide the overlay if needed
- **Font size**: Adjust based on your overlay size and viewing distance
