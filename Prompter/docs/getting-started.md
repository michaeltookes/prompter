# Getting Started

## Installation

1. Build the app from Xcode or copy `Prompter.app` to your Applications folder
2. Launch the app - it appears as the Prompter menu-bar icon in your menu bar
3. No dock icon appears (it's a menu-bar-only app)

## First Launch

When you first launch Prompter:

1. A default deck is created with a sample card
2. Settings are initialized with safe defaults (Protected Mode ON)
3. Click the menu bar icon to access all features

## Creating Your First Deck

1. Click the menu bar icon → "Open Deck Editor..."
2. The editor opens with a sidebar and canvas
3. Click the "+" button to add a new card
4. Choose a layout template
5. Fill in your content (title, bullets, images)
6. Your changes are saved automatically

## Showing the Overlay

1. Press `Cmd+Shift+O` or menu → "Show Overlay"
2. The overlay appears floating above all windows
3. Position it where you want (drag to move, edges to resize)
4. Check the footer - look for the **blue shield** (Protected Mode)

## Before Your Presentation

1. **Verify Protected Mode**: Look for the blue shield icon in the overlay footer
   - If you see a yellow warning triangle, press `Cmd+Shift+P` to enable it
2. **Test**: Menu → "Test Capture Setup..." to verify it's working
3. **Position**: Place the overlay where it won't distract you but is easy to read

## During Your Presentation

1. Start your screen share in Meet/Teams/Zoom
2. The overlay stays visible to you but hidden from your audience
3. Use `Cmd+Shift+→` and `Cmd+Shift+←` to navigate cards
4. These hotkeys work even when Meet/Teams is the active window

## Troubleshooting

### Overlay not appearing
- Press `Cmd+Shift+O` to toggle visibility
- Check if another app is in true fullscreen (the overlay should still appear)

### Can't move or resize overlay
- Disable click-through mode: `Cmd+Shift+C` or menu → uncheck "Click-through Overlay"

### Overlay visible in screen share
- Enable Protected Mode: `Cmd+Shift+P` or menu → check "Protected Mode"
- Look for the blue shield icon in the footer
- If using certain capture software, try sharing a specific window instead of entire screen
