# Presenting with Prompter

You've created your deck. Now it's showtime. This guide covers everything about using Prompter during an actual presentation.

## Before the Call

### 5 Minutes Before

1. **Open Prompter** (if not already running)
2. **Show the overlay** (Cmd+Shift+O)
3. **Go to card 1** - make sure you're at the beginning
4. **Position the overlay** - drag it where you want it
5. **Enable Protected Mode** - via menu bar or Cmd+Shift+P

### Quick Checklist

- [ ] Overlay is visible and positioned
- [ ] You're on the first card
- [ ] Protected Mode is enabled
- [ ] You know your hotkeys (→ next, ← prev)

### Test (If Time Allows)

If this is an important call, do a quick capture test:
1. Start a solo meeting in your video app
2. Share your screen to yourself
3. Verify the overlay is hidden

## During the Presentation

### Starting

When you join the call:
1. Don't share your screen yet
2. Position the overlay one last time
3. Start sharing your screen
4. Begin your demo!

### Navigating Cards

As you move through your demo:
- **Cmd+Shift+→** to advance to the next card
- **Cmd+Shift+←** to go back if needed
- Glance at your notes, then focus on your demo

### If You Need to Hide the Overlay

Sometimes you want it gone temporarily:
- **Cmd+Shift+O** hides the overlay
- **Cmd+Shift+O** again brings it back

### Click-Through Mode

If the overlay is in the way of something you need to click:
- **Cmd+Shift+C** enables click-through
- Your mouse passes right through the overlay
- **Cmd+Shift+C** again to disable

Use this when the overlay covers a button you need to press.

### Adjusting Text Size

If text is too small to read at a glance:
- **Cmd+Shift+=** makes text larger
- **Cmd+Shift+-** makes text smaller

## Reading Your Notes

### The Right Way

**Quick glance, then eyes back**

Your notes should be brief enough that you can:
1. Glance at the card (1-2 seconds)
2. See the key points
3. Return your attention to your demo

You're not reading a script. You're jogging your memory.

### The Wrong Way

**Staring at the overlay**

If you find yourself reading word-by-word from your notes, they're too detailed. Simplify them.

**Forgetting to advance**

If you realize you're 3 demo sections ahead but still on card 1, take a moment to catch up. It's okay to flip through cards quickly.

## Troubleshooting During a Demo

### Overlay is Visible to Audience!

If someone says "what's that floating window?":

**Immediate fix:**
1. Hide the overlay: Cmd+Shift+O
2. Continue without notes for now
3. After the call, test your Protected Mode setup

**Alternative:**
Switch from sharing your entire screen to sharing a specific window or browser tab.

### Overlay Disappeared

If you can't see your notes:
- You might have hidden it: Cmd+Shift+O to show
- It might be behind something: Check other Spaces
- App might have crashed: Check menu bar for the icon

### Wrong Card

If you're on the wrong card:
- Quickly tap Cmd+Shift+→ or ← to find your place
- Cards have numbers in the footer (e.g., "5 / 12")

### Text Too Small/Large

- Cmd+Shift+= to increase
- Cmd+Shift+- to decrease

## After the Call

### Updating Your Deck

After each demo, consider:
- Did any cards need more/less detail?
- Did you wish you had a card for something?
- Were there questions you should prepare for next time?

Update your deck while it's fresh in your mind.

### Preparing for Next Time

- Keep the app running (it uses minimal resources)
- Your deck and settings are saved automatically
- Next time, just show the overlay and you're ready

## Advanced Tips

### Multiple Demo Scenarios

If you demo to different types of customers, consider:
- Keeping a "master" deck with all possible cards
- Reordering cards based on the audience
- Skipping irrelevant cards during the demo

### Handling Q&A

For question-heavy demos:
- Have cards ready for common questions
- Keep them at the end of your deck
- Jump to them when the question comes up

### Timing Reminders

Add timing hints to your cards:
- "MAX 5 MIN on this feature"
- "Check time - should be at 15 min mark"
- "If running short, skip to card 8"

### Emergency Card

Consider having an emergency card at the end:
- Fallback talking points
- "If demo breaks, say..."
- Key messages to leave them with
