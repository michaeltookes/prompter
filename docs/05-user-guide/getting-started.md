# Getting Started with Prompter

Welcome! This guide will help you get Prompter set up and ready for your first demo.

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Launch the App

After installing, open Prompter. You'll notice:
- A small icon appears in your **menu bar** (top-right of your screen)
- **No dock icon** - that's by design!

The menu bar icon looks like a speech bubble with text.

### Step 2: Open the Deck Editor

Click the menu bar icon and select **"Open Deck Editor..."**

A window opens where you can create your presenter notes.

### Step 3: Create Your First Card

The editor opens with a default deck. Let's edit it:

1. Click on the first card in the left sidebar
2. Choose a layout from the dropdown (start with "Title + Bullets")
3. Type a title and some bullet points
4. These are the notes you'll see during your demo

### Step 4: Test the Overlay

1. Close or minimize the editor
2. Press **Cmd+Shift+O** on your keyboard
3. The overlay appears! You can see your notes floating on screen

Try these shortcuts:
- **Cmd+Shift+→** - Next card
- **Cmd+Shift+←** - Previous card
- **Cmd+Shift+O** - Hide the overlay

### Step 5: Enable Protected Mode

Before your actual demo:
1. Click the menu bar icon
2. Make sure **"Protected Mode"** is checked
3. This attempts to hide the overlay from screen sharing

That's it! You're ready to present.

All shortcuts use **Cmd+Shift** plus another key:

| Cmd+Shift+O | Toggle overlay visibility |
| Cmd+Shift+→ | Next card |
| Cmd+Shift+← | Previous card |
| Cmd+Shift+= | Increase font size |

## Before Your First Demo

### Test Protected Mode

1. Open the menu and click **"Test Capture Setup..."**
2. Follow the instructions to start a test call
3. Share your screen and verify the overlay is hidden
4. If it's visible, try sharing a specific window instead of your entire screen

### Position Your Overlay

1. Show the overlay (Cmd+Shift+O)
2. **Drag** the overlay to position it where you want
3. **Resize** by dragging the edges
4. The position is saved automatically

### Adjust for Readability

- Use **Cmd+Shift+=** to make text larger
- Use **Cmd+Shift+-** to make text smaller
- Find a size you can read at a glance

## Tips for Success

### Keep Cards Brief
- 3-5 bullet points per card is ideal
- You should be able to read a card in 2-3 seconds
- Details go in your head, not on the card

### Use Cards Like Slides
- One card per section of your demo
- Advance cards as you move through your demo
- Don't scroll within a card during presenting

### Practice the Shortcuts
- Run through your demo once with the overlay
- Get comfortable with Cmd+Shift+Arrow to navigate
- It should feel natural by your real demo

### Always Test First
- Every screen sharing setup is slightly different
- Test Protected Mode before important calls
- Have a backup plan (share window instead of screen)
