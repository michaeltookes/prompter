# Creating Decks

This guide covers everything about creating and organizing your presenter notes.

## What is a Deck?

A **deck** is a collection of **cards**. Think of it like a stack of index cards, where each card has notes for one part of your demo.

During a presentation, you flip through cards one by one, just like a slideshow of notes.

## Creating a New Deck

1. Click the menu bar icon
2. Select **"Open Deck Editor..."**
3. Your current deck opens (or a new default one)

Currently, the app works with one deck at a time. This keeps things simple - your presenter notes are ready when you need them.

## Understanding Layouts

Each card uses one of **5 layout templates**:

### 1. Title + Bullets
Best for: Talking points, key messages

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Your Title Here     │
├─────────────────────┤
│ • First point       │
│ • Second point      │
│ • Third point       │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**When to use:** Most of your cards will probably use this layout. It's perfect for remembering what to say during each part of your demo.

### 2. Image + Notes
Best for: Screenshots with context

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│   [Screenshot]      │
├─────────────────────┤
│ Notes about what    │
│ to point out...     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**When to use:** When you want to remind yourself which screen you're on and what to highlight.

### 3. Two Images + Notes
Best for: Before/after, comparisons

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ [Image 1] [Image 2] │
├─────────────────────┤
│ Comparison notes... │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**When to use:** When showing how something changed, or comparing two options.

### 4. 2x2 Image Grid + Caption
Best for: Process flows, multiple screens

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ [Img 1]   [Img 2]   │
│ [Img 3]   [Img 4]   │
├─────────────────────┤
│ Brief caption       │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**When to use:** When explaining a multi-step process or showing related screens.

### 5. Full Image + 3 Bullets
Best for: Hero images with key takeaways

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │
│   [Large Image]     │
│                     │
├─────────────────────┤
│ • Key point one     │
│ • Key point two     │
│ • Key point three   │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**When to use:** When one important screenshot needs emphasis, with specific things to call out.

## Adding Cards

In the deck editor:

1. Click the **"+ Add Card"** button at the bottom of the sidebar
2. A new card appears at the end of your deck
3. The new card is automatically selected for editing

## Editing a Card

1. Click a card in the sidebar to select it
2. Choose a layout from the dropdown
3. Fill in the content:
   - Type in text fields
   - Drag images into image slots
4. Changes save automatically

### Adding Images

For layouts with image slots:

1. Find the dotted-line image zone
2. **Drag** an image from Finder onto the zone
3. The image appears in the slot
4. To remove: click the X button on the image

Supported formats: PNG, JPEG, GIF

### Writing Good Notes

Keep these principles in mind:

**Be Brief**
- 3-5 bullet points max
- No full sentences needed
- Just enough to jog your memory

**Be Specific**
- "Mention 99.9% uptime" not "Talk about reliability"
- "Show the export button" not "Demonstrate exporting"

**Be Action-Oriented**
- Start bullets with verbs: "Show...", "Explain...", "Ask..."
- Makes it clear what you should be doing

## Organizing Cards

### Reordering

Drag cards in the sidebar to reorder them. The first card shows when you start presenting.

### Duplicating

1. Select a card
2. Click **"Duplicate"** at bottom of sidebar
3. Edit the copy

Useful when you have similar cards with minor variations.

### Deleting

1. Select a card
2. Click **"Delete"** at bottom of sidebar
3. The card is removed (no undo yet, so be careful!)

## Best Practices

### Mirror Your Demo Flow

Organize cards to match your demo:

```
Card 1: Introduction - who I am, agenda
Card 2: Problem overview - why they're here
Card 3: Dashboard tour - first feature
Card 4: Dashboard tour - key metrics to highlight
Card 5: Export feature - common question
...
```

### One Topic Per Card

Don't cram too much into one card. It's easier to flip to the next card than to squint at tiny text.

### Include Customer Context

For specific customers, add personalized notes:

```
• They use Salesforce integration (mention this!)
• CFO cares about ROI metrics
• Asked about HIPAA compliance last call
```

### Keep Images Relevant

Screenshots should show exactly what you'll be demonstrating. If your product has changed, update the screenshots.

### Number Your Cards

Consider including numbers in your titles:

```
1. Introduction
2. Problem Setup
3. Feature A
4. Feature B
...
```

This helps you know where you are in your deck.
