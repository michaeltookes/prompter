# Key Features

## 1. Invisible Overlay Window

The heart of Prompter is a special window that:

- **Floats above everything**: Your notes stay visible even over full-screen apps
- **Protected from capture**: Uses macOS features to hide from screen recording
- **Click-through mode**: Mouse clicks pass through to apps underneath
- **Moveable and resizable**: Position it wherever works best for you

## 2. Card-Based Notes (Decks)

Instead of one long document, your notes are organized as **cards** in a **deck**:

- Each card represents one section or topic of your demo
- Navigate forward/backward with keyboard shortcuts
- No scrolling during your presentation - just flip to the next card
- Think of it like digital index cards

## 3. Five Layout Templates

Each card can use one of five pre-designed layouts:

| Layout | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Title + Bullets** | Talking points, key messages |
| **Image + Notes** | Screenshots with context |
| **Two Images + Notes** | Before/after, comparisons |
| **2x2 Image Grid** | Multiple screenshots, workflows |
| **Full Image + Bullets** | Hero image with key points |

These templates ensure your notes are readable at a glance - no fiddling with formatting.

## 4. Keyboard-First Navigation

During a demo, you can't be clicking around. Everything works via keyboard shortcuts:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd+Shift+O` | Show/hide the overlay |
| `Cmd+Shift+→` | Next card |
| `Cmd+Shift+←` | Previous card |
| `Cmd+Shift+C` | Toggle click-through mode |
| `Cmd+Shift+P` | Toggle Protected Mode |
| `Cmd+Shift+=` | Increase text size |
| `Cmd+Shift+-` | Decrease text size |

These shortcuts work **even when other apps are focused** - you don't need to click on the overlay first.

## 5. Menu Bar App

The app lives in your menu bar (top-right of your screen), not the dock. This means:

- No clutter in your dock during demos
- Quick access via the menu bar icon
- Runs quietly in the background

## 6. Protected Mode

When enabled, Protected Mode tells macOS to exclude the overlay from screen capture. This is what makes the overlay "invisible" to your audience.

**Note**: This is best-effort protection. We include a test feature so you can verify it works with your specific video conferencing setup before important calls.

## 7. Persistent Storage

Your decks and settings are saved automatically:

- Decks save as you edit (no manual save needed)
- Last opened deck loads when you start the app
- Overlay position and size are remembered
- Settings persist across app restarts
