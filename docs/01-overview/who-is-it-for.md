# Who is Prompter For?

## Primary Users

### Sales Engineers / Solutions Architects

You give technical demos to prospective customers. During these demos, you need to:
- Remember customer-specific details ("They use AWS, not Azure")
- Hit key talking points in the right order
- Show specific features the customer asked about
- Transition smoothly between demo sections

You're sharing your entire screen because you're demonstrating live software, not just slides.

### Technical Pre-Sales Representatives

You support account executives during technical deep-dives. You need quick access to:
- Technical specifications
- Competitive differentiators
- Answers to common objections
- Demo flow reminders

### Demo Specialists

Your entire job is giving product demonstrations. You might do dozens per week. You need:
- Consistent messaging across demos
- Quick reference for different customer scenarios
- A way to customize notes for each call

## Common Scenarios

### The Custom Demo
You've prepared a demo specifically for Acme Corp. Your notes include:
- Their specific pain points from the discovery call
- Features to emphasize based on their requirements
- Questions to ask during the demo
- Competitor comparisons they mentioned

### The Standard Product Tour
You give this demo 10 times a week. Your notes include:
- The optimal flow through features
- Transition phrases between sections
- Key value propositions for each feature
- Timing reminders ("Spend max 5 min here")

### The Technical Deep-Dive
An engineer on the customer side wants details. Your notes include:
- Architecture diagrams
- API endpoints to demonstrate
- Performance benchmarks
- Security certifications to mention

## Why Not Just Use Existing Tools?

| Tool | Problem |
|------|---------|
| PowerPoint Presenter View | Only works with slides, not live demos |
| Sticky Notes app | Visible to everyone when screen sharing |
| Physical notes | Have to look away from camera |
| Second monitor | Eye movement is noticeable |
| Notion/Docs on the side | Takes up screen space, visible when sharing |

Prompter is purpose-built for the "sharing entire screen while demoing" scenario.
